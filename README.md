### How to Run
There are 2 part to this repository, the backend (node) and frontend (react). Go to each subdirectory and create the missing .env files. Then run the following commands in each subdirectory.
* Run ```npm i``` to install node modules
* Run ```npm run start``` to run of local system

### What i Learned 
* It was my first time using these technologies and so it was interesting to learn the methodology of react.
